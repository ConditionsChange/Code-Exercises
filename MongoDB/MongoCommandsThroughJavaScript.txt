Make sure mongodb server is running:
mongod

make sure to use the command mongo, not node to run javascript files. using mongo command will automatically connect to the mongo server. no need to do the same thing again in the script
mongo queries.js

inside your script (queries.js in this case, make sure to use the following commands):
connect / get inside mongodb > multiple databases > collections > documents

//this is the same as creating a new database or switching to a new database (use database_name)
db = db.getSiblingDB('classroom')

db.{collectionname}.insert
